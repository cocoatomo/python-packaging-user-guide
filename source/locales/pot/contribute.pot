#: ../../contribute.rst:54
msgid "The guide is meant to answer questions and solve problems with accurate and focused recommendations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../contribute.rst:57
msgid "The guide isn't meant to be comprehensive and it's not meant to replace individual projects' documentation. For example, pip has dozens of commands, options, and settings. The pip documentation describes each of them in detail, while this guide describes only the parts of pip that are needed to complete the specific tasks described in this guide."

msgstr ""

#: ../../contribute.rst:89
msgid "Here's a quick check: try reading aloud to get a sense for your writing's voice and tone. Does it sound like something you would say or does it sound like you're acting out a part or giving a speech? Feel free to use contractions and don't worry about sticking to fussy grammar rules. You are hereby granted permission to end a sentence in a preposition, if that's what you want to end it with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../contribute.rst:96
msgid "When writing the guide, adjust your tone for the seriousness and difficulty of the topic. If you're writing an introductory tutorial, it's OK to make a joke, but if you're covering a sensitive security recommendation, you might want to avoid jokes altogether."
