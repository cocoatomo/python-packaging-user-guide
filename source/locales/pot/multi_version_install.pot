msgid "easy_install allows simultaneous installation of different versions of the same project into a single environment shared by multiple programs which must ``require`` the appropriate version of the project at run time (using ``pkg_resources``)."

msgid "For many use cases, virtual environments address this need without the complication of the ``require`` directive. However, the advantage of parallel installations within the same environment is that it works for an environment shared by multiple applications, such as the system Python in a Linux distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../multi_version_install.rst:22
msgid "The major limitation of ``pkg_resources`` based parallel installation is that as soon as you import ``pkg_resources`` it locks in the *default* version of everything which is already available on sys.path. This can cause problems, since ``setuptools`` created command line scripts use ``pkg_resources`` to find the entry point to execute. This means that, for example, you can't use ``require`` tests invoked through ``nose`` or a WSGI application invoked through ``gunicorn`` if your application needs a non-default version of anything that is available on the standard ``sys.path`` - the script wrapper for the main application will lock in the version that is available by default, so the subsequent ``require`` call in your own code fails with a spurious version conflict."
msgstr ""

#: ../../multi_version_install.rst:34
msgid "This can be worked around by setting all dependencies in ``__main__.__requires__`` before importing ``pkg_resources`` for the first time, but that approach does mean that standard command line invocations of the affected tools can't be used - it's necessary to write a custom wrapper script or use ``python -c '<commmand>'`` to invoke the application's main entry point directly."
