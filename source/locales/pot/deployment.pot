msgid "`Pynsist <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynsist>`__ is a tool that bundles Python programs together with the Python-interpreter into a single installer based on NSIS. In most cases, packaging only requires the user to choose a version of the Python-interpreter and declare the dependencies of the program. The tool downloads the specified Python-interpreter for Windows and packages it with all the dependencies in a single Windows-executable installer."

#: ../../deployment.rst:70
msgid "The installer installs or updates the Python-interpreter on the users system, which can be used independently of the packaged program. The program itself, can be started from a shortcut, that the installer places in the start-menu. Uninstalling the program leaves the Python installation of the user intact."

msgid "A big advantage of pynsist is that the Windows packages can be built on Linux. There are several examples for different kinds of programs (console, GUI) in the `documentation <http://pynsist.readthedocs.org>`__. The tool is released under the MIT-licence."
