If you don't have that file or directory, then run ``python setup.py egg_info`` to have it generated."

#: ../../distributing.rst:779

msgstr ""

#: ../../distributing.rst:782
msgid "**(Not recommended):** Run ``python setup.py register``.  If you don't have a user account already, a wizard will create one for you. This approach is covered here due to it being mentioned in other guides, but it is not recommended as it may use a plaintext HTTP or unverified HTTPS connection on some Python versions, allowing your username and password to be intercepted during transmission."

msgid "The biggest reason to use twine is that ``python setup.py upload`` (option #2 below) uploads files over plaintext.

msgid "Secondly it allows you to precreate your distribution files.  ``python setup.py upload`` only allows you to upload something that you've created in the same command invocation.

#: ../../distributing.rst:814
msgid "Finally it allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the .asc files into the command line invocation (``twine upload twine-1.0.1.tar.gz twine-1.0.1.tar.gz.asc``). This enables you to be assured that you're typing your gpg passphrase into gpg itself and not anything else since *you* will be the one directly executing ``gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>``."
